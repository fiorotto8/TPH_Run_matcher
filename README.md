# Description

The script needs two `.csv` files:

- The Runlog from the SQL of the DAQ **You should cut it to have only the runs you are interest in**
- The file that the Arduino outputs, no need to cut it

It will output a `.csv` file in a folder that you set with the argument containing the dataframe with the Run, date, T, P, H, VOC
